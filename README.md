PlanetSimulation
================

This netbeans project is a simulation of "planets" in 2d space, using entirely native libraries provided in Java.
By no means is this optimized for maximum performance, and future updates will almost entirely focus on improving performance.

Comments are also being added after the fact, as I had made this in highschool 5+ years ago without comments some of the functions are extremely difficult to follow (I find)

**Controls**

Hit space to pause time and show options menu (options menu is toggling on or off relative motion to a chosen planet)

Click and drag to move around

Double click to create a new planet and scroll to increase/decrease size and mass. Press **R** to randomize the size and mass within the bounds of your max scrolled mass.

Escape closes the program

Message me if you have any suggestions or questions!
