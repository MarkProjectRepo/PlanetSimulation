PlanetSimulation
================

This is a simulation of "planets" in 2d space, using entirely native libraries provided in Java.
By no means is this optimized for maximum performance, and future updates will almost entirely focus on improving performance.

Comments are also being added after the fact, as this was created 4-5 years ago without comments some of the functions are extremely difficult to follow (I find)

**Controls**

Hit space to pause time and show options menu (options menu is toggling on or off relative motion to a chosen planet)

Click and drag to move around

Escape closes the program

Message me if you have any suggestions or questions!
