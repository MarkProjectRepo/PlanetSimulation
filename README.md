PlanetSimulation
================

This is a simulation of "planets" in 2d space, using entirely native libraries provided in Java.
By no means is this optimized for maximum performance, and future updates will almost entirely focus on improving performance.

Comments are also being added after the fact, as this was created 4-5 years ago without comments some of the functions are extremely difficult to follow (I find)

Message me if you have any suggestions or questions!
